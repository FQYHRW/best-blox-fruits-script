### 🔧 Key Features of a Blox Fruits Script

Let’s break down the most popular features and how they can drastically improve your experience in Blox Fruits:

#### 🌾 1. Auto Farming

Auto farming is one of the most valuable tools available. With this enabled, your character can automatically attack enemies, complete quests, and earn EXP or Beli while you're doing other things. Scripts can intelligently choose the best mobs for your level and farm them non-stop, allowing you to reach max level quickly.

#### 🧭 2. Teleportation System

Navigate the **Blox Fruits** world instantly. Whether you need to teleport to specific islands, bosses, quest NPCs, or fruit spawn points, the teleportation function cuts down travel time dramatically. No need to sail between islands—just click and arrive instantly.

#### 🍍 3. Devil Fruit Sniper & Spawn Tracker

Tracking and collecting rare **Devil Fruits** can take a lot of time and luck. With the fruit tracker/sniper feature, the script monitors the server for fruit spawns and notifies you—or automatically teleports you to the location for instant pickup. Whether you're looking for Dragon, Leopard, or Dough, this feature gives you a massive edge in fruit collecting.

#### ⚔️ 4. Auto Mastery

Want to max out your Fruit, Sword, or Gun mastery without constantly grinding? **Auto Mastery** lets you automatically farm mobs using specific skills until your mastery levels are maxed. Perfect for players trying to unlock all abilities for their chosen fruit or weapon.

#### 👁️ 5. ESP for Players and Items

With ESP (Extrasensory Perception), you gain the ability to see through walls and locate players, chests, bosses, and fruit spawns instantly. It’s perfect for both PvP and PvE, as you can anticipate enemy movement or track down objectives faster.

#### 🎯 6. Auto Quests & Boss Farm

Tired of repeating the same NPC quests? Let the script handle it for you. With **Auto Quest**, your character will pick, complete, and turn in quests automatically. Boss farming also becomes easy, as the script can locate and fight bosses, ensuring faster loot collection and more XP.
